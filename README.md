A small animation 2D engine, for P5js and the Canvas API

-----

My goal with this project is to create a small animation 2D engine, which I could use with P5js and directly with the Canvas API (depending of the project).

This project is experimental, under construction, but it works and you can test the different examples contained by the "sketches" directory.

I'm not a specialist of the 2D animation, so I get inspiration in some excellent books :

- Programming Macromedia Flash MX, by Robert Penner's, ed Mc Graw Hill (2002)
- Foundation ActionScript 3.0 Animation, by Keith Peters, ed FriendsofED / Apress (2007)
- Foundation HTML5 Animation with Javascript, Billy Lamberta, ed FriendsofED / Apress (2011)
- The Nature of Code, by Daniel Shiffman https://natureofcode.com/
- Comment créer un moteur d'animation 2D, de Nicolas Legrand

- Flash Math Creativity, 2nd edition", ed FriendsofED / Apress (2004)


Why the name AutomatosJs ?

Because I discovered this definition in a small book of the Monaco National Museum, and I liked it a lot :

- the french original version :
"Dans la Grêce antique existait déjà la notion d'automate : en effet, le terme "automatos" signifiant "qui se meut par soi même" était synonyme de mystère, et évoquait la fascination qu'exercent sur l'être humain des figures dont il ne comprend pas clairement le fonctionnement et qui, cependant, répondent à son éternelle aspiration à rendre le mouvement ou la vie dans la nature".

- the same in english (google translation) :
"Ancient Greece already had the notion of an automaton: indeed, the term "automatos" meaning "who moves by itself" was synonymous with mystery, and evoked the fascination exerted on the human being by figures of which he does not clearly understand how it works and who, however, respond to his eternal aspiration to make movement or life in nature ".


By reading this, I thought it was exactly I was trying to create in Javascript, an "automatos" engine.

The project is not documented for the moment, I hope you'll excuse me for that, and that you'll like to play with this modest Javascript engine.
